1. Update the metadata above (AAAA-EEEE). Note: CCCC = 0 if you don't need any initial
   fund, otherwise, specify in wei.

2. Check what's in the repo:

~~~
  ├── contracts
  │   ├── ChallengeName.sol         # FFFF. main challenge
  │   ├── ChallengeNameFactory.sol  # GGGG. factory to deploy and check the challenge
  │   └── Level.sol                 # interface. don't touch
  ├── scripts
  │   ├── deploy.py                 # HHHH. for deployment to the chain
  │   ├── exploit.py                # IIII. your solution and script to check if it's working
  │   └── pwn.py                    # utils. don't touch
  ├── README.md                     # JJJJ. this file!
~~~

3. If you run scripts/exploit.py, it deploys the challenge and checks if it's working.

4. "ChallengeName" -> a unique challenge name (FFFF, GGGG, HHHH, IIII, JJJJ). And see
   if it's still working.

5. Design your challenge and a way to deploy (FFFF, GGGG)!
6. Add your solution to (IIII)
6. Describe your challenge in README.md below!

# TokenDistributor

The owner wishes to distribute tokens amongst their investors, and they are doing so with the distribute() function which loops through all the investors and sends them their money.
How can you make this distribute function inoperable and prevent everyone from claiming their funds? Hint: Can you make distribute a gas-guzzler?

; NOTE. this will release the code (ChallengeName.sol)!
<CODE>
